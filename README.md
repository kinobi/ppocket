# ppocket
Paulie Pocket is a personnal assistant for getpocket.com

## Usage
Set an env variable __PPOCKET_API_CONSUMER_KEY__ with the **Pocket** consumer key of your app.

## Notes
* So far, as the project reflects my personnal usage of **Pocket**, the ```package pocket``` focus only on the __article__ type.
